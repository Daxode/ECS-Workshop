# ECS-Workshop
Hi, welcome to the Workshop on ECS!

# Heads-up: Repo will be updated until the day before (Oct. 24) @ 22:00


## Before the Workshop
Ideally before the workshop you've:
- Installed `Unity 2022.3.11f1`
- Tried opening the project `/New-Start`
  - (this ensures a quick project launch on the day)
- Validate your IDE is type completing in the project
  - (If not, check `Edit > Preferences > External Tools` and select your editor, making sure to tick the black boxes)

## During Presentation
We'll go back and forth between me presenting, and you guys trying the same and then solving a task. 
To help follow along, i recommend:
1. **Use the Wiki** to help follow along with the presentation. You can [find it here](https://github.com/Daxode/ECS-Workshop/wiki).
2. Try to **write down the code**, instead of just copying it. This ensures you get it in your hands before trying the tasks.

That should be it, ***cya there!***
